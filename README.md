# Commerce operations PR review repository

This deterministic TypeScript workspace models checkout, inventory reservations,
payments, cancellation, outbox delivery, job leases, and reservation expiry. It
uses in-memory state and injected clocks and IDs so pull-request analysis is
stable.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

The repository is intentionally outside Daphne's tracked source. Its local Git
history supplies exact BASE and HEAD commits and can later be published for a
real pull-request run. Scenario tooling and answer keys live in the sibling
`commerce-fixture/` directory so Daphne cannot see them in analyzed source.

The model exercises explicit interleavings only. It does not claim database
transaction isolation or distributed delivery guarantees.
